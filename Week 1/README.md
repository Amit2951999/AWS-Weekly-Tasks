Task: <br />
  i) Create a script in python that deploys all the required aws servics.<br />
  ii) Create a CloudFormation Template for event-based trigger on Amazon S3 using AWS lambda.<br />
      Whenever an object lands on S3, it should trigger lambda and copy the object to another bucket.<br />

Notes:
1. Lambda Functions:<br/>
- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that runs your code in response to events and automatically manages the underlying compute resources for you. 
- You can use AWS Lambda to extend other AWS services with custom logic, or create your own back-end services that operate at AWS scale, performance, and security. 
- AWS Lambda can automatically run code in response to multiple events, such as HTTP requests via Amazon API Gateway, modifications to objects in Amazon S3 buckets, table updates in Amazon DynamoDB, and state transitions in AWS Step Functions.

2. S3: <br />
- Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. <br />
